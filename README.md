# PHRNstack

This is the stack I like to use for web development. It is an acronym for:

Postgresql

Hapi.js

React Native

This is a boiler plate so to speak of what my development case is.
To use, please chmod +x to the 3 generate-* files in the backend folder. Then, generate
the react app using "npx create-react-app foobar". The app.js I have in the frontend
is an example of the whole system working.
